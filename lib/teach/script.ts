/**
 * "Explain -> Demonstrate -> Question" — turns one planned Concept into the
 * scene beats the lesson player/video slice storyboards: an introduction, an
 * explanation (with a named analogy, so adapt.ts can avoid repeating it), a
 * worked example, a checkpoint question, and a transition.
 *
 * Subject-aware visuals are a deliberate, inspectable decision per the spec
 * ("demonstrate how the system decides"): `chooseVisualKind` is a plain
 * lookup table, not an LLM call, so the kind + the reason it was picked are
 * always the same for the same (subject, beat) pair and can be shown in the
 * UI/docs verbatim. Only the visual's *content* (the actual LaTeX/Mermaid/
 * code) comes from the model, grounded in the concept it's illustrating.
