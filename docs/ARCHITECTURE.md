# AI Teacher — architecture

Built for the Bharat Academix AI Innovation Hackathon 2026, Round 2: an AI-powered
virtual teacher that understands uploaded material or a bare topic, plans a lesson,
teaches it as a generated video with a real voice and avatar, questions the
learner, evaluates and adapts, and produces a learning report. See the full brief
in the submission's round 2 technical assessment; the judged weighting is:

| Area | Weight |
|---|---|
| Human-like teaching and adaptation | 20 |
| AI/LLM implementation | 15 |
| RAG grounding | 15 |
| Teaching-video generation | 15 |
| Multilingual | 10 |
| Voice + avatar | 10 |
| Innovation | 5 |
| UX | 5 |
| Documentation | 5 |

The spec is explicit, twice, in bold: **a chatbot, a static video, or an avatar
reading a generated script is not a passing solution.** Every part of this system
is built to demonstrate the full teaching loop, not just answer questions.

## Credentials

`SARVAM_API_KEY` is the only AI credential this project uses or needs. There is
no Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, HeyGen, D-ID key, and no local Ollama —
everything else is local, key-free computation (SQLite, local embeddings,
ffmpeg, headless Chromium). Do not add a dependency on a paid API this project
does not hold a key for.

### Verified Sarvam endpoints

Auth header on every call: `api-subscription-key: <key>`.

| Need | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LLM | `POST https://api.sarvam.ai/v1/chat/completions`, model `sarvam-105b` | OpenAI-shaped. **Reasoning model**: fills `reasoning_content` before `content`. A tight `max_tokens` returns `finish_reason: "length"` with `content: null` before real output is written. `lib/sarvam` defaults to a `max_tokens` well clear of that reasoning cost (28,000 — see `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`, measured, not guessed) and throws a typed `truncated` error instead of returning an empty string — verified live against the real API (see `lib/sarvam/client.ts`). |
| TTS | `POST https://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech`, model `bulbul:v3` | Returns `{"audios":["<base64 wav>"]}`; `lib/sarvam` decodes it to a `Buffer`. `speaker` is optional; **only `bulbul:v3` speakers** (aditya, ritu, priya, neha, rahul, kavya, ishita, shreya, varun, tanya, 38 total) — v2 speakers like `anushka` are rejected. |
| Translate | `POST https://api.sarvam.ai/translate` | `input`, `source_language_code`, `target_language_code` (e.g. `en-IN`, `hi-IN`). |
| STT | `POST https://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text` | multipart; for spoken student answers. |

**There is no Sarvam embeddings endpoint** (404 verified) — RAG embeddings must
run locally.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4. One app, easy to run
  and demo from `git clone` + `SARVAM_API_KEY`.
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3` for every piece of persisted state (learner
  profile, documents/chunks, sessions, plans, scenes, questions, answers,
  assessments, progress, learning paths). No external database. Schema and
  rationale: `docs/SCHEMA.md`.
- `ffmpeg` (installed) muxes the generated video; Playwright/headless Chromium
  captures frames server-side. Both are consumed by the video-generation slice
  and are the two setup steps `npm install` cannot provide — see
  `docs/VIDEO.md`.

## RAG

Local and key-free: `@xenova/transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ONNX, cached
after first download) for embeddings, fused with BM25 lexical scoring for
retrieval. Every answer grounded in uploaded material must carry a citation
back to its source chunk (document, page/section — see `Citation` in
`lib/types.ts` and `document_chunks.page`/`section` in the schema). When
retrieval finds nothing relevant, the teacher says so rather than passing
general knowledge off as the material — the anti-hallucination requirement,
and it must be demonstrable, not just asserted, so the contract is a
computed boolean (`FollowUpAnswer.grounded`, set from retrieval results in
code) rather than the model's own wording. See `lib/teach/ask.ts`.

Parsing an upload into a structure-preserving `ParsedDocument` with citable
locations is `lib/documents/`'s job; everything from retrieval chunking onward
is `lib/rag/`, below.

### RAG slice — implemented (`lib/rag/`)

- **Chunking** (`lib/rag/chunk.ts`): the retrieval-tuned chunker the upload
  route calls. It replaced the foundation's original citation-preserving
  chunker (`lib/documents/chunk.ts`, deleted with its tests when the slices
  were integrated) and overlaps chunks across a semantic boundary
  (whole trailing paragraphs carried forward, never a mid-sentence cut) and
  builds a heading breadcrumb (`"Chapter 4 > Ohm's Law"`) from DOCX/Markdown's
  real heading levels (`ParsedSection.level`, added for this).
- **Embeddings** (`lib/rag/embed.ts`): `@xenova/transformers`,
  `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim, mean-pooled and L2-normalized, run
  entirely locally. The ONNX weights (~23MB, quantized) download once and
  cache under `.cache/transformers/` (gitignored); every chunk's vector is
  computed once and written to `document_chunks.embedding` (a Float32 BLOB),
  so reopening an already-indexed document is instant — retrieval only ever
  reads. Indexing runs in batches, updates the DB after each batch (so
  progress survives a crash), and is fired in the background from the
  upload route; `GET /api/documents/[id]/index` polls
  `getIndexingProgress()` (computed live from `document_chunks`, not
  in-memory state) for the UI (`app/rag-demo/page.tsx`), and `POST` on the
  same route re-runs indexing for whatever chunks still lack an embedding —
  idempotent, for recovering an index interrupted by a restart.
- **Hybrid retrieval** (`lib/rag/retrieve.ts`): BM25 (`lib/rag/bm25.ts`,
  hand-rolled — no dependency, Unicode-aware tokenizer including combining
  marks so Devanagari/etc. tokenize correctly) fused with cosine similarity
  via Reciprocal Rank Fusion, not weighted score blending — RRF only needs
  each method's rank order, sidestepping the fact that BM25 and cosine
  similarity live on incomparable, corpus-dependent scales. Each result
  keeps its raw `denseScore` (cosine, not the fused rank) specifically for
  grounding's relevance gate below.
- **Grounding** (`lib/rag/ground.ts`): retrieves, and either answers
  strictly from the retrieved excerpts (sarvam-105b, instructed to cite
  `[1]`/`[2]`/etc. and never use outside knowledge) or refuses honestly. The
  refusal is gated on a **code-enforced threshold** on the best raw cosine
  similarity in the retrieved set (`DENSE_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD`, currently
  0.32 — see `evals/README.md` for how it was tuned), not on the model's own
  judgement — sarvam-105b's pretraining likely "knows" things like Ohm's Law
  regardless of what the uploaded material says, so refusal can't be left to
  it deciding whether to comply with a system prompt. The gate reads the
  maximum rather than `retrieved[0]`, because the fused RRF order can rank a
  weaker dense match first. Verified live end to end (`npm run eval:rag`;
  see `evals/`). Later slices call `ground()` directly; `POST /api/rag/ask`
  (`{ documentId, question, languageCode }` → the `GroundedAnswer`) exposes
  the same seam over HTTP so the capability is demoable on its own.
- **Cross-language retrieval**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is English-tuned, so a
  Hindi query embedded directly against English chunks (or the reverse)
  scores near-random, and BM25 has zero token overlap across scripts.
  Decision: translate the **query** (not the corpus) into the document's
  detected language via Sarvam's real `/translate` before retrieval
  (`lib/rag/language.ts`); retrieved excerpts stay in the source language,
  and sarvam-105b — fluent across English and the supported Indic languages
  — reads them directly and writes the answer in whatever language the
  learner asked in, in one chat call. Document language is detected once at
  index time from a text sample via Unicode script ranges (Devanagari →
  Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Gujarati, Gurmukhi;
  Latin → English) and stored on `documents.language`. Verified live for
  English material / Hindi (Devanagari) query in both `npm run eval:rag` and
  manually against a real upload.
- **Chapter/concept extraction** (`lib/rag/outline.ts`): chapter boundaries
  are found structurally and for free — DOCX/Markdown heading levels, or a
  "Chapter N"/"Unit N" marker for PDF/PPTX (falling back to one chapter for
  the whole document when no marker is found). Concepts, definitions and
  worked examples inside each chapter need real reading comprehension, so
  that part is one `json<T>()` call per chapter, sequential (not
  concurrent, to stay under whatever per-key rate limit Sarvam holds), with
  one chapter's failure not failing the rest. Stored per document
  (`document_outlines`, migration v2) and generated lazily on first request
  (`GET /api/documents/[id]/outline`) rather than at upload time, since
  outline extraction is an LLM call per chapter and not every session needs
  it immediately.

Demo surface: `app/rag-demo/page.tsx` (upload → indexing progress → outline
→ ask, independent of the lesson-planner UI, which owns `app/page.tsx`).

## The teaching loop — the core of the grade

**Understand → Plan → Explain → Demonstrate → Question → Evaluate → Adapt → Continue**

Modelled explicitly as state (`lib/types.ts`), not as one long prompt:

1. **Learner profile** (`LearnerProfile`): level, prior knowledge, goal,
   preferred style, language, time available, depth.
2. **Lesson plan** (`LessonPlan`): ordered `Concept[]` with a time budget per
   concept, derived from the requested duration — 5 min / 20 min / 60 min /
   multi-day should change lesson *structure*, not just length.
3. **Scenes** (`Scene`): each concept expands into explanation/example scenes
   plus at least one checkpoint scene carrying a question.
4. **Evaluation** (`AnswerEvaluation`): the LLM judges a student answer against
   the concept, returning correct/partial/incorrect **plus a named
   misconception** when wrong — never just "wrong."
5. **Adaptation** (`AdaptationPlan`): an incorrect answer re-explains with a
   **different** analogy than the original scene, gives another example, and
   re-questions. Difficulty moves with performance
   (`AnswerEvaluation.difficultyAdjustment`).
6. **Assessment** (`AssessmentReport`): score, concepts understood, weak areas,
   misconceptions held, recommended revision, next topic.
7. **Learning path** (`LearningPath`): for a broad topic, an ordered path with
   the learner's position in it.

## Subject-aware visuals — an inspectable decision, not hand-waved

The planner classifies each concept's subject and picks a visual kind
(`Concept.subject`, `VisualSpec.kind`/`renderer`, with a required
`VisualSpec.rationale` string so the UI/docs can show *why* that visual was
chosen). The decision is a plain lookup table, not a model call:
`SUBJECT_VISUAL_RULES` in `lib/teach/script.ts` is the authoritative
mapping — it owns every subject's default, the per-beat overrides (a maths
checkpoint shows the bare equation, not the full derivation; a programming
introduction opens with an architecture diagram before code) and the exact
rationale string shown for each. In outline: mathematics → KaTeX working,
physics → Mermaid diagrams with KaTeX for worked examples, chemistry and
biology → Mermaid process/labelled diagrams, history → Mermaid timelines,
programming → Shiki code plus Mermaid architecture, general → HTML bullets
or a Mermaid concept map.

## Video generation

The architectural constraint: no avatar API key exists (no HeyGen/D-ID/
ElevenLabs), so the avatar is rendered by this app itself — an SVG presenter
animated in a real headless Chromium page, lip-synced from the amplitude
envelope of Sarvam's own TTS audio, composed beside a larger subject visual
with captions, captured frame by frame and muxed by `ffmpeg`. Nothing here
depends on a credential this project does not hold.

`docs/VIDEO.md` owns the built pipeline: setup, per-renderer `VisualSpec`
contracts, determinism and caching rules, the avatar and its personas, the
job API, and this slice's own known limitations (which the Non-negotiables
below apply to just as much as the ones listed here).

## Multilingual

Teaching language is chosen at profile time and switchable mid-lesson by asking
naturally ("ab hindi mein samjhao"); lesson state and progress must survive the
switch. Material in one language and teaching in another must work both ways.
Minimum supported: English, Hindi, Hinglish, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi,
Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, Punjabi — see `LanguageCode` in `lib/types.ts`.
"Hinglish" is deliberately not a `/translate` target language code; it is
handled as English text with Hindi code-switching instructions to the chat
model.

## Non-negotiables

- Never commit a key. `SARVAM_API_KEY` comes from the environment; `.env.example`
  documents the one variable required.
- Real behaviour only. If something cannot work, it is documented here under
  Known limitations — never faked with a hardcoded response, a canned lesson,
  or a stub that pretends to call a model.
- Everything works from `git clone` + documented setup with only
  `SARVAM_API_KEY` (see README.md).

## What this foundation slice provides

- **App scaffold**: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4.
  `npm run dev|build|typecheck|lint|test` all pass.
- **`lib/sarvam/`**: a typed client for chat, TTS, translate, STT — the seam
  every later slice calls through. Generous default `max_tokens`, errors typed
  by `kind` (`SarvamErrorKind` in `lib/sarvam/errors.ts`), one retry with
  backoff on 429/5xx only — a 200 whose body isn't JSON fails as
  `invalid-response-body` (a distinct kind from `invalid-json`, the model's own
  output being unparseable) rather than being re-POSTed against a request
  Sarvam already billed — and a
  `json<T>()` helper that validates structured output with zod and retries once
  with a repair prompt on malformed JSON or a schema mismatch. Verified against
  the real API during this build (reasoning content present, truncation error
  fires correctly with a tight `max_tokens`, TTS decodes to a playable WAV,
  translate round-trips English → Hindi).
- **`lib/documents/`**: PDF/DOCX/PPTX/TXT/Markdown → a structure-preserving
  `ParsedDocument` (document → sections/pages → paragraphs) and a chunker that
  never splits a chunk across sections, so every chunk keeps one unambiguous
  citation. PDFs are kept as one section per page rather than concatenated into
  a single string, so real page numbers survive for citations (`pdf-parse`
  still materialises every page's text at once — see `lib/documents/parsePdf.ts`).
- **`lib/db/`**: `better-sqlite3` with a migration that runs on boot, one table
  per entity in the full product (not just tonight's slice — see
  `docs/SCHEMA.md`), and typed accessors; no other module writes raw SQL.
- **`lib/types.ts`**: the shared domain contracts every later slice codes
  against (`LearnerProfile`, `LessonPlan`, `Concept`, `Scene`, `VisualSpec`,
  `Question`, `AnswerEvaluation`, `Misconception`, `AssessmentReport`,
  `LearningPath`).
- **App shell**: a learner-profile form and a document-upload/topic entry
  point on the home page, wired end-to-end — uploading a real PDF/DOCX/PPTX
  parses it and persists both the document and its citable chunks. Uploads
  above 25 MB are rejected with a 413 rather than buffered.
- **`/api/health`**: real reachability of chat/TTS/translate/STT, each from an
  actual call, not a hardcoded "ok". A live result is cached for 30 s and
  replayed with a `cachedAgeMs` marker, so polling the endpoint doesn't burn
  four API calls per request.

The lesson planner, the assessment/adaptation logic, and RAG retrieval
(embeddings + BM25 fusion + grounding) are all implemented — see "RAG slice —
implemented" above and "The teaching engine" below. Deliberately **not** in
this repo yet: the lesson player / video UI (a separate slice, `lib/video/`
below) is not yet wired to the student-facing player described in the task
brief's Step 2.

## The teaching engine (`lib/teach/`)

Implements the teaching loop end to end as explicit state (not one long
prompt), matching the module names to the loop's steps:

| Step | Module | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Understand | `profile.ts` | Free-text instruction ("teach me Chapter 4 in 20 minutes in Hindi...") + the stored `LearnerProfile` → a structured `TeachingIntent`, via `sarvam-105b` (not regex) so an instruction that doesn't map to a simple pattern still works. Also `detectLanguageSwitch()` for "ab hindi mein samjhao" mid-lesson. |
| Plan | `plan.ts` | Topic or document chunks → ordered `Concept[]`. `deriveStructure(totalMinutes, depth)` changes lesson *structure* on two independent axes: duration (essential/structured/deep bucket, `includePracticeConcept`) and the learner's requested `depth` (a 0.7x/1x/1.3x concept-count multiplier plus prompt guidance — `overview` stays high-level and skips derivations, `deep` asks for the underlying mechanism, precise terminology and implementation detail). Concepts are sequenced by a real topological sort over model-proposed prerequisites (`prerequisiteTitles`) — the model proposes edges, code guarantees the order, breaking any cycle rather than trusting it. Citations are built from the actual retrieved chunk text, never from a model-invented excerpt. |
| Explain/Demonstrate/Question | `script.ts` | One concept → introduction/explanation/example/checkpoint/transition beats, from two INDEPENDENT LLM calls fired via `Promise.all` (introduction+explanation; example+checkpoint+transition) rather than one — no added wall-clock time, and each call's smaller schema reasons less and is less likely to truncate (see the token-budget fix below). `chooseVisualKind(subject, beat)` is a plain lookup table (not an LLM call) — the same (subject, beat) pair always yields the same visual kind and the same written rationale, so the decision is inspectable per the spec's "demonstrate how the system decides." Only the visual's *content* (LaTeX/Mermaid/code) is model-generated. The checkpoint beat gets its OWN visual content, explicitly instructed not to contain the worked answer — it used to reuse the explanation's full derivation, which could hand the learner the answer to the question testing it. The explanation beat's `analogyLabel` is what `adapt.ts` tracks to avoid repeating itself. |
| Evaluate | `evaluate.ts` | Judges an answer against the concept: `correct`/`partial`/`incorrect` plus a *named* misconception on anything short of correct — the zod schema requires it via `.refine()`, so "just wrong" can't validate. An exact MCQ match to the reference answer short-circuits to `correct` without a model call (deterministic, not a stub — there's nothing to judge). |
| Adapt | `adapt.ts` | On incorrect/partial: re-explains with a genuinely different analogy (checked against every analogy already spent on this concept this session — `lib/db/accessors/adaptationState.ts`, seeded at scripting time with the original explanation's analogy so even the *first* miss can't repeat it), a new example, a fresh question at an adjusted difficulty. If the model reuses a banned analogy anyway, one repair round is fired before falling through. A second consecutive miss on the same concept drops to its prerequisite instead of a third attempt at the same content. |
| Continue (follow-ups) | `ask.ts` | Answers a mid-lesson interruption grounded in the source document/lesson without touching `lesson_sessions.current_scene_order`, so the lesson resumes exactly where it was. Grounding goes through the RAG slice's real hybrid retrieval (`lib/rag/retrieve.ts`) and its code-enforced anti-hallucination gate (`isRelevant`, thresholded on cosine similarity — `lib/rag/ground.ts`), the same seam `POST /api/rag/ask` uses. Unlike `ground()`, this does **not** hard-refuse an off-document question: when nothing clears the relevance gate it says so, then still answers from general knowledge — the anti-hallucination contract is `FollowUpAnswer.grounded` (computed from retrieval results, not the model's own wording), a machine-checkable signal a caller can always trust regardless of how the model phrased the answer. |
| Continue (assessment) | `assess.ts` | Final quiz drawn from the taught concepts (weighted toward ones missed at checkpoints), then a report. Score/weak-areas/misconceptions-held/concepts-understood are computed **deterministically** from recorded verdicts; the model only phrases `recommendedRevision`/`suggestedNextTopic`, grounded in those computed facts, never inventing a weak area that wasn't measured. |
| Continue (paths) | `path.ts` | Broad topic ("teach me machine learning") or explicit multi-day request → an ordered `LearningPathStep[]`, first step unlocked, rest locked; `unlockNextStep()` advances it. Each step's own `LessonPlan` is generated lazily by `plan.ts` when the learner actually starts it. |
| Orchestration | `session.ts` | Wires Plan → Explain/Demonstrate/Question → persistence, split into a FAST phase and a BACKGROUND phase. `planLessonConcepts()` does one planning call (verified live: ~50s for a 3-concept lesson — a single request, not the old design's minutes) and `persistPlannedSession()` then writes `lesson_session`/`lesson_plan`/`concepts` in one transaction. The route keeps those two halves separate so the deadline in `runLlm()` only ever races the model call: abandoning a slow plan can't commit a session no caller holds the id for (`planTaughtLessonSession()` still composes both for tests and scripts). `scriptTaughtLessonSession()` scripts concepts **concurrently but pooled** (a bounded 3-at-a-time fan-out, not a sequential loop and not one request per concept all at once — the calls are independent, but each concept is itself two large calls, so a 12-concept plan would otherwise burst 24 requests into a rate limit; verified live: ~94s to script all 3 concepts, in the background, not blocking the caller) and persists scenes/questions/adaptation-state as each one finishes; a single concept's failure is isolated (recorded in `scripting_error`, that concept just has no scenes) rather than failing the whole lesson. `lesson_sessions.scripting_status` (`pending`→`in_progress`→`ready`\|`partial`\|`failed`) is what a caller polls. This split exists because the old single-call design took 273s in one live-measured run and then failed outright — see the fixes below. |
| Shared | `llm.ts` | Every `lib/teach` structured call goes through this thin wrapper around `lib/sarvam`'s `json()` rather than calling it directly — see the token-budget/timeout note below. |

### API surface (`app/api/teach/`)

`POST /intent` (parse instruction) · `POST /sessions` (**plans** the lesson
and returns as one request — verified live at ~50s for 3 concepts, not the
old design's 273s-then-fail — with `scriptingStatus: "pending"`; scripting
then runs in the background, verified live at ~94s more for those 3
concepts, in parallel) · `GET /sessions/[id]`
(session + plan + whatever scenes have scripted so far + `scriptingProgress`
+ answers — poll this until `scriptingStatus` is
`"ready"`/`"partial"`/`"failed"`) · `PATCH /sessions/[id]`
(the player reports which scene the student is on, so a mid-lesson question
is answered against the concept actually on screen) ·
`POST /sessions/[id]/answer` (evaluate +
adapt) · `POST /sessions/[id]/ask` (grounded follow-up / language switch) ·
`POST /sessions/[id]/assess` then `POST /sessions/[id]/assess/submit`
(generate quiz, then grade it and produce the report, alongside
`submittedCount`/`scoredCount`/`droppedQuestionIds` so a partially
ungradable submission is visible rather than silently rescaled) · `POST /paths` (broad
topic / multi-day). A judge or the lesson-player slice can drive a complete
session — plan from a topic or an uploaded document, teach it, get asked a
question, answer wrongly and watch it re-explain differently, finish with a
report naming real weak areas — through this surface alone.

### Real-behaviour fixes this slice made, all found by running the actual teaching loop against the live API (not assumed)

**The reasoning-token budget was the root cause of both the slowness and the
outright failures.** `sarvam-105b` spends its `max_tokens` budget on
`reasoning_content` FIRST and only then writes `content`. Measured live on a
heavy structured call: reasoning alone ran 26,000-34,000 characters (roughly
6,500-8,500 tokens), so a call budgeted at `max_tokens: 8000` returned
`finish_reason: "length"` with **content completely empty** three times out
of four — not a model failure, a budget that never had room for output at
all. `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning.effort`, `thinking: false` and
`max_reasoning_tokens` were all tested live against the same prompt: none is
rejected, and none reliably reduces reasoning (`reasoning_effort: "low"`
produced *more* reasoning than the baseline, 8,834 vs 5,905 characters) — do
not spend time on them. The two real levers, both applied here:

1. **Budget for it.** `lib/sarvam/config.ts`'s `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` raised
   from 4096 to **28,000** — on the order of the 24,000-32,000 range the
   measurement calls for — and `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` from 30s to 90s to match
   (a call that size, verified live, averages ~47s). This is a shared
   `lib/sarvam` default, not a `lib/teach`-only override, because every
   slice calling `sarvam-105b` hits the same reasoning cost. Re-verified at
   this value: **4/4 succeeded** on the exact prompt shape that failed 3/4
   times at 8000, averaging 47s.
2. **Ask for less per call.** `script.ts`'s `scriptConcept()` now fires two
   smaller calls in parallel instead of one large one (see the table above)
   — this is each caller's own responsibility, not something raising the
   shared default alone fixes, since a call can still be arbitrarily large.
3. `lib/teach/llm.ts` adds one bounded outer retry (on top of `lib/sarvam`'s
   existing one internal repair attempt) specifically for `truncated`/
   `invalid-json`/`invalid-schema` — a safety net for a genuinely malformed
   response, not the primary fix; it does not retry `timeout`/`http`/
   `network`/`config` errors, where a same-request retry wouldn't help, nor
   `invalid-response-body`, where the request was already processed and
   billed. Because retries multiply attempts, the retry is bounded twice:
   `llm.ts` applies a 150s budget as a brake on *starting* a second attempt
   (and shortens its timeout to what's left — a brake, not a hard ceiling,
   since nothing cancels a call already in flight), and `runLlm()` gives any
   request-path ask a hard 180s deadline, answering 504 with
   `kind: "deadline-exceeded"` instead of holding the caller open. Because an
   expired deadline abandons the in-flight work, whatever `runLlm()` races
   must not write — see the session route's plan/persist split above.

Two smaller fixes, also found live:

4. **A JSON-mode response still needs the exact key names spelled out.**
   `json<T>()`'s `response_format: json_object` makes the model emit valid
   JSON, but not necessarily matching the caller's zod schema — verified
   live, a prompt that only *describes* the desired fields in prose got a
   plausible-but-wrong shape back (`description`/`bucket`/`examples` instead
   of `summary`/`subject`/`difficulty`/`visualContent`/`visualCaption`).
   Every `lib/teach` prompt now ends with an explicit `"Respond with ONLY a
   JSON object of exactly this shape: {...}"` block naming every key.
5. Language codes like `"en-IN"` alone weren't a reliable instruction either
   — verified live, the model sometimes wrote Hindi despite an `en-IN`
   request. `lib/teach/profile.ts`'s `languageInstruction()` names the
   language in words ("Write in English (language code \"en-IN\").") and
   every module routes through it instead of interpolating the raw code.

## The student experience (`app/`)

Integrates every slice above into the actual product a learner uses, end to end.

- **Entry** (`app/page.tsx`): upload material or name a topic, plus one
  free-text instruction box — `POST /api/teach/intent` parses it into a
  `TeachingIntent` (level, topic, minutes, language, depth, style) via
  `lib/teach/profile.ts`, shown back to the learner as editable fields
  before anything is built. This is the "Understand" step made visible,
  not a twelve-field form. A learner profile is created/updated silently
  from the confirmed intent and kept in `localStorage`
  (`lib/client/learner.ts`) — this is a single-learner-per-browser demo,
  which is what makes a second session personalized by the first.
- **Plan review** (`app/learn/[id]/LearnPageClient.tsx`): shows the
  `LessonPlan`'s concepts, per-concept minutes, and — per the spec's
  "demonstrate how the system decides" — each concept's chosen visual with
  its `rationale` (`VisualPreview.tsx`; KaTeX content renders faithfully
  client-side since it's cheap, everything else shows its rationale/caption
  with the polished render appearing in the generated video), plus any
  grounding citations, while scripting finishes in the background.
- **The lesson player** (`LessonPlayer.tsx`): plays one teaching segment of
  video at a time — a concept's intro/explanation/example beats, then a
  single re-explanation scene after a wrong answer — rather than rendering
  the whole multi-concept lesson as one video up front, since adaptation
  scenes don't exist until the learner actually answers (see
  `lib/video/render.ts`'s `sceneIds` option). A concept's own beats plus the
  *previous* concept's trailing "transition" scene (authored to bridge
  into this concept, not close out the last one — found by actually running
  a lesson end to end) form each segment; the segment always stops before
  the checkpoint scene, which is rendered as an interactive question
  (`CheckpointQuestion.tsx`) instead of baked into video, answered by typing
  or by voice (`POST /api/speech`, Sarvam STT). A wrong answer shows the
  named misconception, the re-explanation video, and a fresh question at
  adjusted difficulty (`FeedbackCard`) — a judge can see the adaptation
  happen, not a canned "incorrect, it's B". `AskAnything.tsx` is a
  persistent panel for mid-lesson interruptions and language switching
  (`POST /api/teach/sessions/[id]/ask`), grounded with a visible citation
  (`Citations.tsx`, which can open the full source passage via
  `GET /api/documents/[id]/chunks/[chunkId]`) or plainly marked general
  knowledge.
- **Assessment and report** (`Assessment.tsx`, `Report.tsx`): the final
  quiz, then the learning report — score, concepts understood, weak areas,
  misconceptions still held, recommended revision, next topic.
- **Progress dashboard** (`app/progress/`, `GET /api/progress`): every
  session for this learner, its report, per-concept mastery, and any
  learning paths — one fan-out over existing accessors
  (`lib/db/accessors/*`), not new state.
- **Learning paths** (`app/paths/[id]/`): a broad/multi-day request builds a
  `LearningPath`; each step's own `LessonPlan` is generated (a normal
  `POST /api/teach/sessions` call) when the learner starts that step.

## Known limitations

The teaching-video slice keeps its own list (viseme approximation, no
illustrative art, single-process job queue, even-paced captions) in Known
limitations in `docs/VIDEO.md` — that list is part of this contract, not an
appendix to it.

- **A video segment renders live, in real time, verified end to end at
  ~1-2 minutes for a 3-scene concept segment** (Playwright screenshots every
  frame at 24fps, then ffmpeg encodes) — real progress is shown while it
  renders, not a fake spinner, but there is no pre-rendering or caching
  ahead of where the learner is, so each new segment (and each
  re-explanation after a wrong answer) has this real cost. Acceptable for a
  single-learner demo; a multi-learner deployment would want to pre-render
  the next segment while the current one plays.
- **Learning-path step completion is not tracked automatically.**
  `updateLearningPathProgress` exists but has no caller — starting a step
  from `app/paths/[id]/` generates a normal lesson session, but finishing it
  doesn't unlock the next step or mark this one complete. The UI says so
  plainly rather than pretending it works; `lesson_sessions` has no
  path/step foreign key to key that off, which is the schema change a real
  implementation would need.
- **The final quiz is typed only, no voice input** — `CheckpointQuestion.tsx`'s
  voice answering (`POST /api/speech`) is wired into the lesson player's
  checkpoints, not `Assessment.tsx`'s end-of-lesson quiz, since the two
  don't share a component. Scoped out under time pressure, not a technical
  limitation.
- **Revisiting a `/learn/[id]` URL for an already-completed session replays
  the lesson from concept 1** rather than jumping straight to its report —
  the page has no "already completed, here's what happened" branch. The
  report itself is still reachable from `app/progress/`.
- **PPTX slide order** is inferred from the numeric suffix of
  `ppt/slides/slideN.xml` rather than the presentation's relationship-ordered
  slide list. This matches the overwhelming majority of exporters (including
  PowerPoint and Google Slides) but would misorder a hand-edited deck whose XML
  filenames don't match display order.
- **Dev-toolchain vulnerability**: `next@15.5.24`'s bundled `postcss` has two
  known advisories (XSS in stringified CSS output, source-map path traversal).
  These affect the build tool, not the shipped app's runtime; `npm audit fix
  --force` would upgrade to Next 16, which the architecture calls for staying
  off of. Tracked, not silently ignored.
- **Health check's STT probe** posts a valid-but-silent WAV, so it verifies the
  endpoint is reachable and authenticated, not that transcription accuracy is
  good — a true accuracy check needs real speech audio, which a health check
  can't manufacture. The format the lesson player actually records
  (`audio/webm;codecs=opus`, uploaded as `answer.webm` through
  `POST /api/speech`) was verified separately against the live endpoint and
  transcribed correctly.
- **Hinglish retrieval only works when the query's key terms are actual
  English words** ("explain the circuit ka concept"). `lib/rag/language.ts`
  treats `hinglish` as English for both document-language detection and
  query translation (see `LanguageCode`'s doc comment in `lib/types.ts`) —
  correct for English material asked about in English-with-Hindi-flavour,
  but a query whose key nouns are *transliterated* Hindi in Latin script
  ("karant kya hota hai" for "what is current") has zero token overlap with
  English chunks for BM25, and MiniLM doesn't understand transliterated
  Hindi as equivalent to the English word either — so that query is
  correctly-but-unhelpfully treated as unrelated. Verified live: real
  Devanagari Hindi ("विद्युत धारा क्या है?") retrieves correctly against
  English material; transliterated Hinglish for a term with no English
  cognate in the query does not. A dedicated transliteration step (Latin
  Hindi → Devanagari before the existing translate path) would fix this;
  out of scope for this slice.
- **Outline extraction (`lib/rag/outline.ts`) prefers the original upload on
  disk** (`lib/documents/storage.ts`, `data/uploads/`, gitignored) — it
  re-parses the source file rather than reconstructing structure from
  already-chunked text, since that gives real paragraph/heading boundaries.
  If that file is ever missing (moved/deployed environment without it, or a
  DB reset that wasn't paired with clearing `data/uploads/` — hit for real
  while recording `docs/assets/demo.mp4`, see
  `scripts/record-demo/README.md`), `GET /api/documents/[id]/outline` falls
  back to `reconstructParsedDocument` (`lib/rag/outline.ts`), which rebuilds
  a usable-but-not-exact `ParsedDocument` from `document_chunks` — chunk
  boundaries aren't real paragraph/heading boundaries and retrieval chunks
  overlap, so text near a boundary appears twice; DOCX/Markdown chapter
  detection is preserved by reading heading depth back out of the stored
  `section` breadcrumb, but a document whose headings start below h1
  reconstructs one level shallower than the source. That degraded outline is
  returned uncached (`document_outlines` is only written from the on-disk
  parse), so restoring the file makes the next request produce the exact
  outline. A file that is present but fails to parse still surfaces the real
  parse error rather than falling back. Only a document with neither the
  file nor any chunks still returns 409; `GET /api/documents` also flags
  such a document `available: false` so it isn't offered as a selectable
  source.
- **PDF chapter titles can be truncated.** Chapter detection for PDF/PPTX
  looks for a "Chapter N"/"Unit N" marker in a section's first line
  (`lib/rag/outline.ts`'s `chapterMarkerIn`). Real PDFs typically have a
  blank line between a heading and its body, which `pdf-parse` preserves as
  a paragraph break — but when it doesn't (observed with some
  programmatically generated PDFs, including this slice's own eval
  fixture), the heading and the whole page's body text merge into one
  "line", and the title is hard-truncated at a word boundary (80 chars) to
  contain the damage. Bounded rather than exact in that case; the *chapter
  grouping* (which page belongs to which chapter) is unaffected either way.
  `evals/fixtures/electricity-basics.pdf` demonstrates this exact case.
- **`lib/teach/plan.ts` grounds a lesson plan against a document by feeding
  the model up to ~16,000 characters of raw chunk text**, not a semantic
  retrieval pass — reasonable for "Chapter 4" (narrowed by
  `filterChunksBySectionHint`) on typical chapter lengths, but a very long
  chapter or an un-sectioned document gets truncated rather than
  intelligently summarized.
- **The prerequisite-drop in `adapt.ts` only looks within the current lesson
  plan's concepts** (`concept.prerequisiteConceptIds`), not across sessions
  or the broader learning path — a concept whose real prerequisite was taught
  in an earlier session has nothing to drop to here.
- **`lib/teach/path.ts` step titles/summaries are not translated into the
  learner's teaching language** — they're navigational metadata, not taught
  content, so this was scoped out; each step's actual `LessonPlan` (generated
  lazily when the learner starts it) is fully multilingual via `plan.ts`.
- **Background scripting is in-process fire-and-forget, not a durable job
  queue.** `app/api/teach/sessions` kicks off `scriptTaughtLessonSession()`
  without awaiting it, relying on the Node process staying alive after the
  response is sent — true for `next dev`/`next start` (a persistent process,
  which this app is), false for a serverless/edge deployment. There's no
  external queue (no Redis, no worker), so a server restart mid-scripting
  leaves a session's `scripting_status` stuck at `'in_progress'` forever with
  no automatic recovery. Acceptable for a single-process hackathon demo;
  would need a real job queue for a multi-instance or serverless deployment.
- **`POST /api/teach/sessions/[id]/assess` is not idempotent.** Every call
  generates and persists a fresh quiz question set, with no check for an
  existing one and no way to fetch a previously issued quiz — so a client
  retry after a network blip leaves an orphaned question set attached to the
  session's concepts. Fixing it properly means tagging quiz questions with
  the session id (a schema change), deliberately not attempted under tonight's
  time pressure. The practical impact is contained rather than silent:
  `assess/submit` now reports `submittedCount`/`scoredCount` and
  `droppedQuestionIds`, so a learner answering from an orphaned batch gets a
  visible discrepancy instead of a quietly wrong score.
- **No CI workflow is wired up.** GitHub Actions currently refuses to start
  any job on the account this repo is hosted under ("recent account payments
  have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased") — an account
  billing block, not a repo or code problem. A red check would block every PR
  from merging with no way to go green, which is worse than no check at all,
  so `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was deliberately left out rather than
  committed and left permanently failing. Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run
  lint`, `npm test` and `npm run build` locally before pushing until Actions
  billing is restored, then add the workflow back.
